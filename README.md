SPOTS

An interactive photo-sharing web application.

📌 Overview

se_project_spots is a front-end web application that enables users to create, view, and interact with photo posts in a social-media-style interface. The project emphasizes responsive design, clean UI/UX, and modular, maintainable CSS and JavaScript. This repository was developed as part of the “Project 3: Spots” assignment for the TripleTen Software Engineering Bootcamp. GitHub +1

🚀 Features

Profile Management — Users have a profile section (avatar + user info) where they can view their posts and, in some variants, edit their profile. GitHub +1

Photo Posts Grid — A grid layout of images that the user uploads or manages; each image may have a caption/description. GitHub +1

Interactive Elements — Examples include hover states on images, responsive behavior when resizing browser or viewing on mobile. Uses Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout. GitHub +1

Responsive & Accessible UI — The layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) and maintains usability across devices.

Clean, Modular Codebase — Utilizes HTML5 semantic tags, CSS3 (with BEM methodology), and vanilla JS (or minimal frameworks) to keep it lean and maintainable. GitHub

🛠 Technologies & Tools

HTML5: Semantic markup for structure and accessibility.

CSS3: Styling via Flexbox, Grid, media queries for responsiveness. Employs BEM for maintainability. GitHub

JavaScript: Handles dynamic behavior, image uploads, user interactions, state management.

Build Tools: Uses webpack, babel, postcss for bundling, transpiling, and post-processing.

✅ Why This Project / What It Demonstrates

Demonstrates the ability to build a responsive, mobile-friendly web app from design (e.g., Figma) to code.

Shows use of modern front-end tooling and best practices: modular CSS, semantic HTML, build pipeline.

Highlights the importance of user-friendly interactions and visual feedback (hover effects, grid layout, upload flows).

Good demonstration of a portfolio piece: a real application (though primarily front-end) showing full page UI, user flows, and responsive design.

📂 Deployment

A live version of the app is (or can be) hosted via GitHub Pages or another static-host provider. Example: https://hunterevon.github.io/se_project_spots/ GitHub
